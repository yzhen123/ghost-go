```
<current directory>
  |-posts   # for your markdown posts, supports sub directory
  |-files   # files below this directory will be copied to /public
  |-public  # this directory include the generated blog site
  |-tmp     # temp directory, speed up generating
  |-themes  # ghost themes
```

this command not only create directories, but also generate demo post, config.yaml and even downloading a default ghost theme Casper. You can right your posts in `/posts`.
